# Problemspace
The typings generated by the lib is too slow, crashing the TS server.

## Look into type generation
The trpc package has a way to generating types via class that is constantly being modified throughout chaining.
```typescript
type OmArgs<TShapePath> = {
  path: TShapePath
}

const createOm = <TShapePath>(args: OmArgs<TShapePath>) => new Om(args)


const take = <TShapePath>(path: TShapePath) => {
  return createOm({
    path
  })
}

const either = <TOmOne extends Om, TOmAnother extends Om>(one: TOmOne, another: TOmAnother) => one.either(another)

const maper = om({
  test: take('test.foo.bar')
})


maper.eval({
  test: {
    foo: {
      snap: '' // TS missing error, missing propery bar
    }
  }
})

```
